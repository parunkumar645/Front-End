## 1️⃣ Introduction to HTML5

### 🌐 What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. HTML uses a series of elements (tags) to define different parts of a webpage like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

### 🆕 What is HTML5?

**HTML5** is the fifth and latest major version of HTML, released in 2014. It introduced new elements, attributes, and behaviors that make web development more powerful, semantic, and multimedia-friendly.

### 🎯 Why HTML5?

- **Better Semantics:** New semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` make code more meaningful and readable.
- **Multimedia Support:** Native support for audio and video without plugins like Flash.
- **Enhanced Forms:** New input types and validation features.
- **Graphics and Effects:** Canvas and SVG support for drawing and animations.
- **Offline Capabilities:** Web storage and offline application support.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Designed with responsive and mobile web in mind.
- **APIs:** Geolocation, drag-and-drop, web workers, and more.
